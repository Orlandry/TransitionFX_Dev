## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Widget-Layer Rendering Mode (Phase A — runtime)** — `UTransitionPreset` now exposes a `RenderingMode` switch (`Post Process` / `Widget Layer`) and a `WidgetTransitionMaterial` slot. In Widget Layer mode the transition is drawn by the new `UWidgetTransitionEffect` as a full-screen Slate widget on the viewport overlay, so it also covers UMG widgets added to the viewport — a long-standing limitation of the PostProcess path. The widget material must use the **User Interface** material domain; `Priority` doubles as the overlay Z-order in this mode. Existing presets are unaffected (`RenderingMode` defaults to `Post Process`, and a custom `EffectClass` is always respected). UI-domain variants of the built-in materials will ship in a follow-up.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

**Built-in Effects (+2, total 28)**
- **Fan** — A pinwheel-style wipe where angular blades sweep out from the center and rotate to cover the screen, like an opening folding fan. Adds the `DA_Fan` preset, `M_Transition_Fan` master material, `MI_Transition_Fan` instance, preview GIF, and README (EN/JA) Built-in Effects table entry.
- **Slice** — The screen is cut into strips that slide off-screen in alternating directions with staggered timing. Slice count, direction, softness, and stagger are adjustable. Adds the `DA_Slice` preset, `M_Transition_Slice` master material, `MI_Transition_Slice` instance, preview GIF, and README (EN/JA) Built-in Effects table entry.

- **Transition Color per Preset** — `UTransitionPreset` now exposes a `bOverrideTransitionColor` toggle and a `TransitionColor` property. When enabled, the color is applied to the material's color parameter at the start of the transition (e.g., fade-to-white) without requiring a parameter override at the call site. An explicit color supplied via `FTransitionParameters` at the call site still takes precedence.
- `DA_SequenceSamples` — Sample `UTransitionSequence` data asset demonstrating the sequence system out of the box (`Content/Data/Sequence/`).

### Changed

- Changed the project's default map to an empty map to speed up editor and packaged startup.
- `SetParameters` now logs a warning (`LogTransitionFX`) when an override targets a scalar, vector, or texture parameter that the material does not expose, instead of silently ignoring it. This surfaces cases such as a color override having no visible effect because the material lacks that parameter.
- Bumped plugin `VersionName` in `TransitionFX.uplugin` to match the release version.
- Release ZIP no longer includes local development tooling configuration (`.claude/`).

### Fixed

- Fixed the transition color override having no effect. The material color parameter is named `FadeColor`, but `ColorParamName` was set to `Color`, so `SetVectorParameterValue` was silently ignored. This also affected `QuickFadeToBlack`/`QuickFadeFromBlack` and the new per-preset `TransitionColor`. Updated the constant and the documentation (FAQ, Quick Start, API Reference) to use `FadeColor`.
- Added a dedicated factory and asset type actions for `UTransitionSequence`. The asset now appears as a top-level "Transition Sequence" entry in the Content Browser right-click menu, matching the existing `Transition Preset` workflow. Previously, sequences could only be created via the generic `Miscellaneous → Data Asset` class picker.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

**Built-in Effects (+1, total 26)**
- **Diamond Band Wipe** — A dynamic transition where a diamond-shaped band expands from the center, splitting apart to reveal the underlying scene.

**Sequence System**
- `UTransitionSequence` data asset for chaining multiple transitions back-to-back.
- `PlaySequence` / `StopSequence` / `IsSequencePlaying` / `GetCurrentSequenceStep` API on `UTransitionManagerSubsystem`.
- `PlaySequenceAndWait` latent Blueprint node.
- `OnSequenceCompleted` and `OnSequenceStepChanged` delegates.

### Fixed

- Fixed a one-frame background flash between sequence steps caused by the previous step's PostProcessVolume being destroyed before the next step's effect was initialized. During a sequence, the effect now hot-swaps across steps and is only torn down when the full sequence completes.
- Fixed an issue where an incorrect material instance was set for DA_FadeToBlack.
- Refactoring to a more efficient node configuration for M_Transition_Diamond.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

**Built-in Effects (+3, total 25)**
- **Sliding Doors** — Two panels slide from opposite sides and meet at the center, like elevator or airlock doors
- **Dissolve** — Classic transition where the screen dissolves like mist or sand using procedural noise
- **Corner Wipe** — A directional wipe that starts from a specified corner and expands diagonally across the entire screen; origin corner (0–3) is dynamically selectable

**Material Functions**
- `MF_StarSDF` — Star signed-distance-field material function for star-shaped effects

**Event System**
- `OnTransitionProgressChanged` — Broadcasts the eased progress value (0.0 to 1.0) each tick while a transition is active
- `OnProgressThresholdReached` — Fires once when the eased progress crosses a registered threshold value

**C++ / Blueprint API**
- `AddProgressThreshold(float Threshold)` — Registers a progress threshold (0.0 to 1.0) for one-shot callback notification
- `ClearProgressThresholds()` — Removes all registered progress thresholds

### Changed

- Optimized FString allocation in `STransitionPreviewPanel` by reserving capacity before PascalCase-to-snake_case conversion loop

### Documentation

- Added UEFN (Unreal Editor for Fortnite) compatibility FAQ to README (EN/JP)
- Updated API Reference (EN/JP) with `OnTransitionProgressChanged`, `OnProgressThresholdReached`, `AddProgressThreshold`, and `ClearProgressThresholds`
- Updated Quick Start guides (EN/JP) with new event system documentation (5 delegates)
- Added effect preview GIFs for Dissolve, Sliding Doors, and Corner Wipe
- Added Corner Wipe to the Built-in Effects table in README (EN/JP)
- Marked "OnTransitionProgress Delegate" as completed in the Roadmap
